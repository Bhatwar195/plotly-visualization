# 📊 Plotly Data Visualization Repository

This repository contains practical and beginner-friendly examples of data visualization using **Plotly in Python**.
It covers fundamental and advanced plots used in data analysis and machine learning.

The goal of this project is to understand how interactive visualizations help in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
